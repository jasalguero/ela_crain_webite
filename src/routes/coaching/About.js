                Ela Crain helps people to become top-performers and rebels with
                a cause.

                <br />
                As an entrepreneur herself, Ela has founded and managed an
                advertising agency in London, and a Webby nominee non-profit
                organization, called Mash Stories — listed among the Top 50
                Websites in 2015. She has a BA in Archaeology, an MA in Media,
                and an MSc in Brain Sciences from University College London.

                As well as one-to-one sessions, Ela gives workshops on
                overcoming procrastination and perfectionism, developing
                leadership skills, building an inspired community, and adopting
                a success mindset.
